Keep the "Add To Cart" ajax button on the screen instead of switching to a "Checkout" button. This way, multiples can be added to the cart.

== Description ==

Normally, when using ajax add-to-cart, the “Add To Cart” button is auto-hidden after the item is in the cart. But what if you want customers to be able to add multiples of an item to the cart? This add-on plugin for Easy Digital Downloads makes that “Add To Cart” button come back so they can click it again and again and again to their hearts content.
